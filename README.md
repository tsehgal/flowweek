# MakeTime

> Make time for what matters

An AI-powered weekly planner that transforms your goals into a visual, editable time-blocked schedule.

## 🎯 What It Does

Simply describe your weekly goals in natural language, and MakeTime generates an optimized, color-coded schedule that helps you achieve them. Then customize it with drag-and-drop editing.

**Example Input:**
```
I want to work out 4 times a week in the morning around 4-6am.
I need to study AI for 30 minutes every day.
I work 9am-5pm Monday to Friday.
I want to apply to jobs for 90 minutes per week.
Family time from 6-9pm every evening is essential.
```

**Output:** A beautiful visual calendar with all activities intelligently scheduled.
